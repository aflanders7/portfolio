                    <h2>Hello there! I'm Audrey Flanders.</h2> 
                    I am a dedicated computer science student with a strong passion for creative problem-solving.  
                    I thrive on tackling complex challenges. I am committed to learning and hope to contribute my 
                    skills to projects that push the boundaries of what technology can achieve. Outside of my studies, 
                    I find joy in reading, painting, creative writing, and spending time in nature.
